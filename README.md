# Â React App
This project is a weather forecasting project conceived and set up by 
Maciej Magic Skwierawski, Pawel Bzinkowski belatedly assisted by Mike Teuten.

The Weather forecasting app has been designed to deliver the forecast for today at the chosen location, together with a further five day forecast for that location. There is also a history section that stores a record of the forecasts that have been viewed. The record of the visited locations is stored in local storage and allows for the user to instantly click on a stored location and check for the weather at that location. This facility is of great benefit to travellers who are able to prepare for local weather conditions at their destinations.

# Compliance and tools.

In order to comply with the rules, the project had to be completed using at least 2 tools that had not been previously utilised in this BootCamp.

The tools chosen were Tailwindcss written over React and utilising the Visual Crossing Weather Appi. 

The journey has been very interesting as Tailwindcss is a new and exciting tool that appears to be very self willed on occasions causing a great deal of head scratching. A steep learning curve for all of us.

Surely regular use and practice will prove that is is very useful tool.
